# Use the front controller as index file. It serves as a fallback solution when
# every other rewrite/redirect fails (e.g. in an aliased environment without
# mod_rewrite). Additionally, this reduces the matching process for the
# start page (path "/") because otherwise Apache will apply the rewriting rules
# to each configured DirectoryIndex file (e.g. index.php, index.html, index.pl).

# By default, Apache does not evaluate symbolic links if you did not enable this

# Disabling MultiViews prevents unwanted negotiation, e.g. "/index" should not resolve
